# StarCannon Project

A cross-platform game engine for Desktop/Web platform built on OpenGL/WebGL, that simulates procedural generated terrain combining game elements.

Check the github url: https://github.com/DomainFlag/StarCannon and pull the latest version possible if there is any!

## Getting Started

The necessary libraries are GL, GLFW, SOIL, GLEW, each should be included in the /usr/include folder, each game engine component is
executed within its folder with make command. Currently only on Linux machines it can be executed, latter cmake will be used to make it cross-platform on different os like Windows.

## Structure

The main folder is consisted of 13 programs each independent that consists of a header file, cpp file with its implementation, makefile used to generate the executable for the main program with the engine component.

There is also a Tools folder, that contains different utilities like the Matrix & vector manipulation, Obj reader for 3D obj files, Heightmap reader for reading grayscale 3D terrain, Simplex Noise implementation for terrain generation and the Obj files and Textures, all apart.

## Miscellaneous

All the components were tested, although there are situations where the iostream and glfw library have some unresolved internal issues in their lastest versions with minor leaks of ~76000oc for iostream when it's included and ~80oc for glfw when opening up the window.

The project was managed with GIT as the main version control system(GitHuB).

The main component StarCannon that combines all the engine components will be added sooner, as soon as the QuadTree will be implemented, maybe tomorrow..., and more robust changes will be added to the code for performance optimization including commentaries will be added as soon as there will be sufficient time. 

Stay in touch, more updates and revisions will come.
